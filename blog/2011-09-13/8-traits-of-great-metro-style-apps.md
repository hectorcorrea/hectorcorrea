# 8 Traits of Great Metro Style Apps
These are my notes from [Jensen Harris](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jensenh/about.aspx) session at Build Windows conference on Tuesday September 13th, 2011.  Jensen is the Director of Program Management for the Microsoft Windows User Experience Team.

## Metro style design

* There are no apps yet. Opportunity.
* Sidebars are for the system, top and bottom are for the app
* Win32 vs Metro apps
* Content before Chrome
* Apps re-imagined


## Fast and Fluid

* Touch faster than GUI, GUI faster than command line
* Touch first approach
* Beautiful, fast, and fluid vs crap
* Most controls support animation
* Touch has its own language, don’t mimic the mouse
* Semantic zoom: not only does the content change,  but also the meaning (e.g. show categories rather than details)
* Don’t separate touch and mouse interfaces
* A screen without touch is a broken screen - in a few years


## Snap and Scale beautifully (form factor)

* minimal: 1024x768 
* widescreen: 1366x768+
* snap view (required)
* portrait (optional)


## Use the right contracts

* Binds metro style apps together
* Share, Search, and Picker
* Share content with other apps (e-mail, social network)
* Search: each app implements its own view
* Picker: select a picture from file system or the web (sample: change user profile picture from a picture in Facebook without having to do the intermediate step of saving picture in my hard drive first)

## Invest in a great Tile

* Icons are yesterday’s way of representing apps
* The Tile should be an extension of the app
* You can also create tiles from content of the app (e.g. tile your favorite photos album or weather from SCE)


## Feel connected

* “Windows is alive with activity”
* Live tiles
* We don’t have folders, we have groups
* Folders put stuff down one level, it’s hard to name them
* People do love to make groups
* Notifications are displayed for a small period of time, after that update the tile


## Roam to the cloud

* Every app gets per-user cloud storage for settings, state, and small amount of user content (via Live ID)
* Applications preserve state as they go, do not require explicit save
* Roam settings (favorite cities, last level on game played)
