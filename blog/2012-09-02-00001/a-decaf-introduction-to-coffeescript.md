# A Decaf Introduction to CoffeeScript
<img style="float:left;" src="https://hectorcorrea.com/images/coffeescriptcup.png" />Below are the links to the slides and code samples that I used during my presentation **A Decaf Introduction to CoffeeScript** that I gave earlier this month.

* Slides [PDF](https://hectorcorrea.com/downloads/intro-to-coffeescript-slides.pdf)
* Code Samples [zip](https://hectorcorrea.com/downloads/intro-to-coffeescript-code.zip) or [github](https://github.com/hectorcorrea/intro-to-coffeescript) 

The slides are pretty bare since I spent most of the time showing code samples. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions as you go through them.

You can find a detailed explanation of the Binary Tree sample that showed during the presentation on this [other blog post](https://hectorcorrea.com/blog/drawing-a-binary-tree-in-coffeescript/3).
