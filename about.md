I am a software developer in Hartford, CT. This site is where I host [my blog](https://hectorcorrea.com/blog/) and post small pieces about software development.

I have been a software developer for many years. Since 2016 my focus has been on Ruby on Rails applications for academic libraries with a strong focus on indexing and searching data through Apache Solr.

Currently I work at the Princeton University Library as part of the team in charge of the [discovery application](https://catalog.princeton.edu/) and its related services ([code](https://github.com/pulibrary/marc_liberation)).

From 2016 to 2020 I worked at the Brown University Library on several projects related to discovery ([code](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/bul-search)), [research profiles](https://vivo.brown.edu/) ([code](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/vivo-on-rails)), and [archives](https://www.riamco.org/) ([code](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/riamco)). Most of these applications were Ruby on Rails application using Solr, some of them through Blacklight others straight through.

From 2014 to 2016 I worked at Penn State on the development of [ScholarSphere](https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/), Penn State&#39;s institutional repository ([code](https://github.com/psu-stewardship/scholarsphere)).

Before academic libraries I was heavily involved on the Microsoft stack (C#, ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server) building complex and high-volume applications for a variety of industries.

My main areas of interest are web development in small and collaborative teams. I also enjoy learning new and interesting technologies and you&#39;ll find a wide variety of topics in my blog including algorithms and data structures, Ruby on Rails, Node.js/JavaScript, C#/ASP.NET MVC, Go, NoSQL databases, event-driven architectures, and bit of functional programming.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Colima&#39;s Technology Institute (Mexico) and several certifications including Microsoft Certified Software Developer (MCSD), ScrumMaster, and MongoDB for Developers (M101P).

In the last few years I&#39;ve given presentations at local events as well as regional and national conferences in a variety of topics including [Solr](https://github.com/hectorcorrea/solr-for-newbies), [Node.js](https://hectorcorrea.com/blog/introduction-to-node-js/51), [NoSQL/MongoDB](https://www.slideshare.net/hectorwashere/introduction-to-nosql-with-mongodb), [Linked Data](https://hectorcorrea.com/blog/introduction-to-ldp/67), and [sustainable software development](https://hectorcorrea.com/blog/build-your-own-software/70).
