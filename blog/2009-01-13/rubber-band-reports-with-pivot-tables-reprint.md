# Rubber Band Reports with Pivot Tables (reprint)
<img align="left" width="120" src="https://hectorcorrea.com/images/pivottable.jpg" />A few years ago I wrote an article for the (now defunct) Universal Thread Magazine on how to create reports using Excel's Pivot Tables. The article was titled **Programming Rubber Band Reports with Pivot Tables** and showed how to create Excel Pivot Tables from a Visual FoxPro (VFP) application.

Although the article is more than 6 years old I still get questions every now and then about the code samples that I mentioned in the article. The original code samples mentioned in the article can be found [here](https://hectorcorrea.com/downloads/correa_pivottablesvfp.zip) A VB.NET version of the code can be found at [here](https://hectorcorrea.com/downloads/pivottable.zip) 

A PDF version of the article can also be found [here](https://hectorcorrea.com/downloads/correapivottableswhitepaper.pdf).
