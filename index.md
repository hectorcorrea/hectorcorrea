# Welcome to HectorCorrea.com

I am a software developer in Connecticut. This site is where I host [my blog](/blog) and post small pieces about software development.

My main areas of interest are web development in small and collaborative teams. I also enjoy learning new and interesting technologies and you&#39;ll find a wide variety of topics in my blog including algorithms and data structures, Go, Ruby on Rails, Node.js/JavaScript, C#/ASP.NET MVC, NoSQL databases, Linked Data, and bit of functional programming.

Feel free to browse around and contact me at [hector@hectorcorrea.com](mailto:hector@hectorcorrea.com) if you have any questions or comments.
